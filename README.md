# MovieMarathonTracker
This repository is meant to track watching for any movie/ tv marathon. I'm going to be using it for tracking my MCU content usage.

## Usage

The usage is really simple.

Have a sheet named `InitialSheet.csv` and run the script with `python tracker.py`

You'll now be loaded into the prompt like so:

```
Welcome to your marvel tracker!!!
What action would you like to do?
> 
```

## Commands

* Help
	* Get the avaialble commands
* Next n items
	* Display the next {n} items you need to watch
* Watched n items
	* Mark that you watched {n} items
* Unwatched n items
	* Unmark that you watched {n} items, maybe you want to rewatch some more, or you messed up marking
* Get info
	* Get some basic metadata
* Exit
	* Self explanatory

## Next Steps

I'm going to be adding in some more metadata and info for different items in the rewatch. I'm planning on connecting iMDB and a couple of other APIs that would get information on where to watch it.
